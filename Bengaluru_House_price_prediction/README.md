## Install Required Packages

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, run the following command to install all dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## If you encounter any issues, ensure you have a virtual environment set up:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run the House Price Detection Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:
Type in any command promt 
jupter notebook

Open the house_price_detection.ipynb file from the project directory.

## Execute the cells in order to:
Preprocess the data.
Train the model.
Generate and save the required pickle files (e.g., model artifacts) in the artifacts folder.
Ensure the artifacts directory exists, or the notebook creates it automatically.

## Run the Server
Once the model files are ready in the artifacts folder, start the server:

python server.py

The server.py file should be responsible for:
Loading the model artifacts.
Serving predictions via an API or a frontend.
Handling any necessary routes (e.g., /predict, /status).


## Access the Application
After starting the server, it will typically run on localhost at a specified port (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000 if using Flask).

Open a browser and navigate to the server address to interact with the app.

## Troubleshooting Tips
Dependencies Issue: If package installation fails, ensure the correct Python version is being used and dependencies are compatible. Use tools like pipdeptree to debug dependency conflicts.
Server Issues: Check the logs for errors if the server doesnâ€™t start. Missing pickle files or incorrect paths are common issues.
Notebook Errors: Ensure all paths and file dependencies referenced in the notebook are correct relative to the project structure.
