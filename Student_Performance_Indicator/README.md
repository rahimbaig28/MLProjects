## Project Overview
In this project, I applied various data preprocessing steps and trained a machine learning model to predict target outcomes. The dataset used is [Dataset Name] (or provide a brief description if it's a generic dataset), and the main objective is to demonstrate the end-to-end ML workflow.

### Key Steps
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Engineering
- Model Selection
- Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Evaluation


## Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`

## Install required packages

pip install -r requirements.txt
